                <p>Hello! My name is Jeremy Mecham! I am a Junior at Weber State University studying Computer Science.
                    I already have a degree in UX design, but wanted to get more into the nitty gritty of 
                    computers and programming. I have enjoyed the program so far, and have especially liked
                    learning C++ and SQL!

<!--
1: Give webiste a generic background
2: create a container that will have my picture, name, and a short description
3: create a button that blurs the picture and shows the rest of the text
4: have a show less button take place of the show more button, which will revert the card to how it was
